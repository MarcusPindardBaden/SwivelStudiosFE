            If you’re anything like myself you have gone on (more than one occasion) to facebook, twitter, instagram, LinkedIn, or checked the news 
            and have been slammed with an article or personal thought-piece explaining how <i>“x product is actually DESTROYING the environment”</i> or that 
            <i>“EVERYTHING you thought about y is WRONG”</i> or <i>“You will RUIN the planet if you’re not using THIS product”.</i> They’re often damning, divisive and eventually 
            serve to sell their own product or alternative.

            To spark some life back into your hopes of being able to do your part, we’ve done some reading around and truth be told, 
            most of the easiest & most effective steps to reducing your carbon footprint haven't really changed over the last 20 years.

        There have been some major changes & developments in renewable tools & processes, with fantastic inventions being developed to drastically change our world, 
        such as the <a href = "https://theoceancleanup.com/">sea cleaning vessels that catch plastic products in the ocean</a>. They’re amazing contributions to society, 
        but what you can do doesn’t have to be this grandiose, or even big at all.

            What we want to focus on with this article isn’t the big picture, but more small, simple yet effective change that won’t impact your lifestyle. 
            Just a couple of adjustments to routine & a couple of smart purchases (these aren’t our products or sponsored products) and you can already start building a 
            solid green foundation and culture to your household.
